/* 
    *** Why TypeScript with ReactJS ***
        => With static type checking, you get to learn potential bugs as you are typing the code, 
        then heading to the browser and figuring out at runtime.

        => Provides a way to describe the shape of an object hence providing better documentation
         and autocomplete.

        => Makes maintenance and refactoring of large code bases much easier.

    *** What is the problem of using of TypeScript ***
        => I have to write a lot more code than i normally do and the compiler keeps complaining. 
        I simply do not know what to do about those error.
        => It does not seem to be productive for me.
